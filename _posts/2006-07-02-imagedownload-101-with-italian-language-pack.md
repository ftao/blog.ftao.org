Recently , I update the Imagedownload with Matteo Vannucchi &#8216;s Italian Language Pack. Because I really didn&#8217;t do any change for the Extension itself.

I submit it with the same vesion number â€œ1.0.1&#8243; . And unfortunately the old item is delete, and new one is still wait for edtion&#8217;s review. You have no item to download.

I&#8217;am really sorry for that.

So Please download it from here temporarily.
