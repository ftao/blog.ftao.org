<span dragover="true" id="_user_kai.hendry@gmail.com" style="color: rgb(121, 6, 25);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">About the “javascript support for form.py” idea?</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kai Hendry suggest me to see this </span></span>specification ([Web Form 2.0][1]).

This specification gives some Form validation types , including date, email, range , etc.  
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>These types of validation might be implemented by browser someday. And It also provides an customer validate attribute.

I don&#8217;t think I can implement the Web Form 2.0 in 3 month.

Before this specification is implemented, a javascript validation framework is still useful.  
And  
Even this specification is implemented, I think this kind of javascript  
will be needed in some time. For example, validation relate to more  
than one fields.( eg. One filed is required only anther check-box has  
been checked.)
